When we make such games, we get to see all the errors. We get problems and when we solve them our coding knowledge gets improved If you have a little knowledge of coding then it’s a good thing because in this it is important for you to have some knowledge of coding otherwise you might face some difficulty In this we have used mostly HTML and Javascript We have not used much CSS in this game, so let’s understand some important codes step by step.

Archery Game Using Html Css And Javascript

First of all, for any project, there is its <title></title> title, from which the user will know which project it is
If you do not link your CSS file to HTML, then the design of the project is not correct, so for linking we have used this tag <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”style.css” />
<body> This is the most important tag of HTML because within this tag we have to link our code which you will see in the code below
<svg></svg> We have used all our paths and svg in svg in this game
<g id=”arrow”> With the help of this element we have created our arrow with which our game will start
<g id=”target”> We have created this element to aim at our target which you will see in the game
<c id=”bow” this element is used to create the bow so in the code to create the bow it will need to be entered
<g class=”arrow-angle”> With this element we have created the angle of the arrow which helps in targeting which you can see in the game
<g class=”miss” if you are playing the game and if your arrow misses the target then a text message is displayed to you due to the medium of this element, that is why we have used this element
<span>Draw back an arrow and launch it!</span> We have used this text at the top of the game to give a message to the user.
